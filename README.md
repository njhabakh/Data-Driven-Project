Data-Driven-Project
===================
Project by Ajith Narendra Jhabakh.
Three buildings with different electricity consumption patterns were chosen for analysis.
The Model used to predict the load had two major features:
A Time-of-week indicator variable and 
A Piecewise continuous outdoor temperature function.
Three scenarios were assumed for the respective buildings which includeOccupied state only,Unoccupiedstate onlyandBoth occupied and Unoccupied statesbased on certain assumptions on occupancy times.
The best fit was found using the minimum Root Sum of Square(RSS)values.
